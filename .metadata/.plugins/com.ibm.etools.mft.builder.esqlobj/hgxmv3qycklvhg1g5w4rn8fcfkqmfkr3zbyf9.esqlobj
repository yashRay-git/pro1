	 * ReadEvents is called on a new transaction that is a separate transaction from the message
	 * flow, and that runs before the message flow transaction.
	 *
	 * After ReadEvents completes:
	 * - the current transaction is committed to ensure that any database locks obtained during
	 *   ReadEvents are released.
	 * - All events in NewEvents are moved to Ready state.  This means that they are ready to be
	 *   dispatched.
	 *
	 * Parameters:
	 * IN NewEvents REFERENCE.  This is a reference to a ROW. ReadEvents must create children of
	 *                          this ROW for each event that is being processed.
	 *                          Each child must include a 'Usr' field and a 'Key' field, with the
	 *                          field names being case sensitive.

		 * Here you select all unprocessed events from the event store.

		 * In general, it is not good practice to delete or update the events here because this
		 * transaction will be committed even before the BuildMessage procedure is called.
		 * Under certain circumstances, for example, if you do not need assured delivery of the
		 * events, it is acceptable to update or delete the events here. This means that
		 * the deletion or update is committed before the message flow processes the in-memory
		 * copies of these events. If the broker, execution group, or message flow is stopped
		 * or redeployed in the meantime, the in-memory copy is lost, and the events are never
		 * processed by the flow.
		 *
		 * NOTE: You do not need to filter out events that are currently dispatched here.
		 *       The framework ensures that events are not duplicated by comparing the 'Key' field
		 *       to the 'Key' field of dispatched events.
